Data Structures & Algorithm question (easy / medium difficulty), e.g. on Dynamic Programming or Arrays. Example: https://leetcode.com/problems/k-diff-pairs-in-an-array/

API interaction: make a REST API call and parse JSON result and process that data (e.g. output max value). 
The data may be a string and contain “$”, “,” and “.”. May need to paginate the calls. Use “requests” library in Python.


array of currency conversion rates. E.g. ['USD', 'GBP', 0.77] which means 1 USD is equal to 0.77 GBP
an array containing a 'from' currency and a 'to' currency
Given the above parameters, find the conversion rate that maps to the 'from' currency to the 'to' currency.
Your return value should be a number.


Example:
You are given the following parameters:


Rates: ['USD', 'JPY', 110] ['US', 'AUD', 1.45] ['JPY', 'GBP', 0.0070]
To/From currency ['GBP', 'AUD']
Find the rate for the 'To/From' curency. In this case, the correct result is 1.89.
